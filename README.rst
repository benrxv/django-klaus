django-klaus - port of klaus Git web viewer to django
=====================================================

`Klaus <http://github.com/jonashaag/klaus>`_ is a simple Git web viewer that Just Worksâ„¢ originally created by Jonas Haag, written in Flask.

If you need just to host a standalone Git web viewer, then check out the `original <http://github.com/jonashaag/klaus>`_ which makes it easier. On the other hand, if you need to integrate a Git viewer with a django application, then this is a way to go!
